Introduction to CSS:
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.
- It defines how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen, in print, or in other media.

Linking CSS to HTML:
- CSS can be linked to an HTML document using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  ```
- Alternatively, CSS styles can be applied inline within HTML elements using the `style` attribute or internally within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.


Basic Syntax:https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp
- CSS rules consist of a selector and a declaration block.
- The selector identifies the HTML element(s) to which the styles will be applied, and the declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
- Each declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon.
