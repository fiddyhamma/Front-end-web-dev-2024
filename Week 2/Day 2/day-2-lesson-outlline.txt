Day 2: Styling text, links, and backgrounds

Selectors: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp
- Selectors target HTML elements to apply styles.
- Element selectors target specific HTML elements (e.g., `p`, `h1`, `div`).
- Class selectors target elements with a specific class (e.g., `.classname`).
- ID selectors target elements with a specific ID (e.g., `#idname`).
- Attribute selectors target elements based on their attributes (e.g., `[attribute=value]`).

Properties and Values:
- CSS properties define the visual aspects of an element (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `background-color`).
- Properties are followed by a colon (`:`) and values are specified after the colon.
- Values can be keywords, numerical values, colors, or other units (e.g., pixels, percentages).

Applying Styles:
- Styles are applied to HTML elements using CSS rules.
- Examples of styling text, backgrounds, borders, margins, padding, and more.

Interactive Exercises:

1. Selector Practice:
   - Write CSS selectors to target different HTML elements provided.
   - Use various types of selectors (element, class, ID, attribute) where applicable.

2. Styling Challenge:
   - Apply different styles to HTML elements in a given webpage.
   - Experiment with different properties and values to achieve specific visual effects.
