Understanding CSS selectors and specificity
These tasks provide opportunities for practicing CSS selectors and specificity by applying different styles to HTML elements based on their classes, IDs, and relationships within the document structure.

**HTML File (index.html):**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Selectors and Specificity</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header id="header">
        <h1>Welcome to CSS Selectors and Specificity</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
        <p class="highlight">This paragraph has a highlight class.</p>
    </div>
    <footer>
        <p>This is a paragraph in the footer.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
