Create a beautiful website for a web design agency

3.1 Media query - Web design agency project

We're going to be creating a beautiful website for a web design agency.

I have included the html, css and image files (check the assets folder) in this folder

Usually with web design agencies, you'll see them demonstrating their best work, but their websites are usually quite simple.

We're going to be creating something with a big block of text telling people what they do and then just simple clean design.

We're going to be a creative design agency at dev.com (name the website whatever you want) and we've got two little blocks of text that describes a little bit about our work. (Feel free to modify the content as you wish)

And finally at the bottom we've got a footer with our company motto Create, Develop design.

Your task is to make sure that when it's displayed on a smaller screen, namely an iPhone, that our blocks now change and are centered and are responsive to make better use of the screen real estate.

We want to make sure that when the screen size is a certain size, the blocks stack on top of each other.

So this is going to require a little bit of the knowledge that you learn this lesson about the display, property floats and also responsiveness.

Your task is to make this website mobile responsive using media queries
