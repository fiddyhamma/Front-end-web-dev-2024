CSS3 introduces advanced styling features such as gradients, shadows, transforms, and transitions.
Gradients: Create smooth color transitions.
Shadows: Add depth and dimension to elements.
Transforms: Rotate, scale, skew, and translate elements in 2D or 3D space.
Transitions: Apply smooth animations to CSS properties.
Example: Adding gradients and shadows to elements, transforming elements on hover.

CSS animations and transitions allow us to add movement and interactivity to web elements.
Animation: Define keyframes to specify the animation sequence.
Transition: Specify the property to animate and its duration.
Example: Creating animated buttons, sliding navigation menus, and fade-in effects.
